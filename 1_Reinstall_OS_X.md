# Reinstall OS X

Test bed:
* MacBook Pro(Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)

Steps:
1. Turn on your Mac and immediately press and hold on **option** key.

2. Make sure that your Mac has a **connection to the internet**.
(If you got a error 2002F, you have to check internet connection. In my case, I needed DNS 8.8.8.8 on router.)

3. Reinstall OS X => OS X Yosemite(In my case) > Continue > Agree > Select the disk > Install 
(If the disk doesn't appear, you have to Erase your disk in Disk Utility.)

4. Restart..
